**charizard-ai** is a blazing-fast Neovim plugin that brings AI assistance directly into your editor. With a sleek floating chat UI, support for local and remote models (Gemini, Deepseek, Gemma via Ollama), and prompt-based interactions, it empowers developers to code smarter, faster, and with flair — all without leaving Neovim. Code so hot, it needs a Poké Ball to contain it!
