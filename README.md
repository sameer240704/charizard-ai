**charizard-ai** is a blazing-fast Neovim plugin that brings AI assistance directly into your editor. With a sleek floating chat UI, support for local and remote models (Gemini and Codellama), and prompt-based interactions, it empowers developers to code smarter, faster, and with flair — all without leaving Neovim. Code so hot, it needs a Poké Ball to contain it!

> [!NOTE]
>
> This project is undergoing frequent changes, and many exciting features and new AI models will be added successively. Stay tuned! 😎
